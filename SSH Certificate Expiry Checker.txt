## SSH Certificate Expiry Checker

### Description
This Bash script, `crt.sh`, is designed to check the expiry dates of SSL/TLS certificates (`cert.pem` files) located on remote servers via SSH. It facilitates the monitoring of certificate expiration dates, helping system administrators ensure the security and availability of SSL/TLS certificates used in their infrastructure.

### Functionality
The script performs the following functions:

1. **SSH Connection**: Establishes SSH connections to remote servers to retrieve certificate information.
2. **Certificate Expiry Check**: Examines `cert.pem` files in specified directories (`/etc/letsencrypt/live` by default) on remote servers.
3. **Date Calculation**: Determines the start and expiry dates of certificates and calculates the remaining days until expiration.
4. **Output Display**: Outputs certificate information including server, certificate path, start date, expiry date, and days remaining until expiry.
5. **Error Handling**: Includes extremely basic error handling for SSH connectivity and file existence, providing error messages if issues are encountered.

### Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Bash is installed on your system.
2. Set up SSH key-based authentication for connecting to remote servers.
3. Modify the `servers` array in the script to include the list of target servers.
4. Optionally, adjust the `port` variable to specify the SSH port used for connections.
5. Run the script in a terminal or command prompt.

### Requirements
- Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
- SSH key-based authentication for remote server connections
- Proper configuration of `port` variable and `servers` array in the script
- Certificates stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live` (or update the `path` variable in the script)
